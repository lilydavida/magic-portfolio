# How I'm Helping My Sister's Music Business Stop Bleeding Money (Mid-Experiment Update)

My sister's online music coaching business was stuck. Despite converting 80% of leads, there was so much uncertaininty in her business cycle. Students kept dropping out, payments were a nightmare, and she was burning out chasing new clients.

"I think I need help with marketing," she said. "Maybe Facebook ads?"

Classic product problem disguised as a growth problem.

## Initial Hypothesis: Wrong Problem

My first instinct was to jump into growth tactics. Built her a website, designed graphics, set up hosting. Standard playbook stuff.

But the data didn't add up. An 80% conversion rate with poor retention? That's not a top-of-funnel problem.

**Working theory:** We're optimizing the wrong part of the funnel.

## Discovery: What the Data Actually Said

I ran a two-week discovery sprint with user interviews, competitive analysis, and customer journey mapping.

**Key finding:** We had a positioning problem, not a lead generation problem.

The business was built as a premium service targeting a price-sensitive market that didn't understand the value proposition.

## User Research: The Retention Story

I surveyed existing students to understand churn patterns:
- Communication: WhatsApp vs email (90% vs 20% open rates)
- Payment friction: PayPal fees were deal-breakers for small transactions
- Scheduling: Expat parents needed flexible payment cycles
- Engagement: Kids responded to gamification, not traditional progress tracking

**Hypothesis:** We're serving multiple segments with different jobs-to-be-done.

## Segmentation Experiment: Six Distinct Use Cases

Based on user research, I'm testing six customer segments:

**Church Ministry Leaders** → Event management and team coordination
**Expat Parents** → Flexible scheduling across time zones
**Christian Parents** → Faith-integrated musical development
**Kids Platform Users** → Talent development and creative expression
**Church Worship Leaders** → Seasonal program management
**Diaspora Families** → Cultural heritage preservation

**Early signals:** Generic landing page: 12% engagement. Targeted pages: 31-67% engagement.

## Initial Interventions: Low-Hanging Fruit

While testing the segmentation hypothesis, I'm fixing obvious retention issues:
- Moved from email to WhatsApp for reminders
- Added multiple payment options to reduce FX friction
- Built in grace periods for irregular expat salaries
- Added simple gamification features

**Early results:** 40% improvement in show-up rates, 25% reduction in payment delays.

## What I'm Learning (So Far)

**Current working theory:** Most growth problems are actually product-market fit problems in disguise.

My sister's business didn't need better marketing. It needed better product-market fit. It didn't need more leads. It needed to keep the customers it already had.

## What's Next: Testing the Hypothesis

This is still an experiment. The segmentation might be wrong. The messaging might not resonate.

**Next 30 days:**
- Launch targeted campaigns for top 3 segments
- Build analytics infrastructure for proper cohort analysis
- Test pricing models for different customer types
- Validate segment-specific retention strategies

## The Meta-Learning

If you're struggling with growth, your problem might not be what you think it is. Before you optimize your funnel or increase your ad spend, ask yourself:

- Do I have product-market fit for my current positioning?
- Am I solving the right problem for the right customer?
- Are my retention metrics healthy enough to support growth?

Sometimes the best growth strategy is stepping back and understanding what you're actually trying to grow.
